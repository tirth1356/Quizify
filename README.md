## 🔹 Features

- 🧠 **Concept & Question Extraction** – Breaks down your educational content into key concepts and stores them like a structured map for easy reference.
- 📊 **Hierarchical Topic Ranking** – Organizes topics and subtopics in a clear hierarchy, helping you see the big picture and drill down into details.
- ❓ **Smart Quiz Generation** – Automatically creates 3–15 questions per topic, with selectable difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, or Mixed.
- 📈 **Weak Point Analysis** – After completing a quiz, highlights the concepts you need to focus on for improvement.
- ⚡ Fast & Serverless – Generates responses quickly (1.3–8 seconds) on a fully serverless website, no lag, just instant results.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. You paste or upload educational content.  
2. The app sends the content to the **Groq API**, which processes it and extracts key concepts.  
3. Concepts are visualized in a **heatmap** or **hierarchy tree**.  
4. You can generate quizzes based on difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, or Mixed).  
5. Results appear instantly, ready to practice or share!  

All AI processing happens **serverless**, so you don’t need to manage a backend – only the frontend is hosted, but it communicates seamlessly with the Groq API.
